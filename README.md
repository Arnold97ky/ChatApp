A simple messaging app,where you can create a chat room and on the same time share a video to visualize or a book to read together.



Plan:
- Work with the messaging app and add feature :
send and receive pictures or video
Delete or add a member for conversation
Send location

-Third party:
Work with Cocopoad and Firebase fot the backend

-Chat Room “Anime”
If got time add the idea Chat Room Anime
Idea: User can chat with any member in the app Chat but also can create a Chat room where they can add link from anime and visualize and comment on the same time.




Problem:
Pod saving on gitHub
Pod: googleSignIn, got a error during installing
